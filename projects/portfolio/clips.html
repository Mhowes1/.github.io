                    <p>February 22, 2024</p>
                    <p>Jimmy Jackson was driving home from a recruiting trip in June 2023 when his phone buzzed. Matt
                        Swope was calling. </p>

                    <p>Swope touched base with the James Madison assistant about a week earlier to tell him a coaching
                        change may occur at Maryland. He wanted Jackson to be his pitching coach if he got the job.</p>

                    <p>This time, Swope had more pressing news. A change was imminent. He wanted to confirm Jackson was
                        committed to Maryland before Swope’s promotion became official. Jackson said he was. Maryland
                        made the move official the next day, then Jackson received another phone call from a different,
                        yet familiar voice. </p>

                    <p>“Hey man,” said Johnny Poss, then head coach at Division III Wilson College. “You’re gonna be a
                        Terp?” </p>

                    <p>Jackson, still trying to keep his unofficial move quiet, acted confused.

                    <p>“I’ve known Swope for like 25 years,” Poss said. “I’m going too.”</p>

                    <p>Baseball has connected Swope, Jackson and Poss for two decades. Now, their divergent paths have
                        intersected in College Park. They form a staff with deep local ties — valuable connections that
                        shape a recruiting emphasis on keeping the region’s talent home.</p>

                    <p>Sweat was thick and runners’ legs were weak Saturday as the sun positioned itself over
                        Agricultural History Farm Park in Derwood for the Independent School League, Mid-Atlantic
                        Athletic Conference and Interstate Athletic Conference cross-country championships.</p>
                    <p>The five-kilometer course that challenges runners with sloping hills and a shallow creek crossing
                        became more difficult as temperatures reached the high 70s.</p>
                    <p>Hours of summer workouts under blistering conditions prepared Potomac School as it pushed through
                        the heat to claim its second straight MAC title. Sasha Minsky led the Panthers with his
                        first-place finish in 17 minutes 6.8 seconds. </p>
                    <p>Beginning in June, the Panthers engaged in student-led runs under the direction of Minsky and
                        fellow senior captains Alex Mathews and Max Zeldes. Minsky credited the offseason training for
                        mentally preparing his team.</p>
                    <p>“We work harder than anybody in the summer,” Minsky said. “I think we definitely have an edge. I
                        like to think that our team is better in harsher conditions.”</p>

                        width="300">
                    <p>For The Washington Post</p>
                    <p>November 11, 2023</p>
                    <p>As a freshman, Aidan MacGrath told her coach, “I’ll never be able to do that.” Skinny and small,
                        as she described herself, the West Springfield High runner did not believe she could win a state
                        competition. </p>
                    <p> Three years later she proved her younger self wrong, darting to a first-place finish at the
                        Virginia Class 6 girls’ cross-country meet to cap her senior season and vault the Spartans to a
                        team victory with 62 points, just ahead of Robinson (64) and W.T. Woodson (65). </p>
                    <p>“It’s like your dream came true,” MacGrath said after finishing the 5K race at Oatlands in
                        Leesburg in 18 minutes 11 seconds. “… I’m just happy I was able to push through it and hear
                        everyone cheering and coming first.”</p>
                    <p>MacGrath began consistently going on long runs her junior year to strengthen her body, she said.
                        She also started to monitor what she was eating to keep herself in a healthy physique.</p>
                    <p>“I just stopped caring, really, overall about what other people said and what my body looked like
                        versus what a healthy body looked like,” she said. “Once I noticed all of that and I actually
                        put in the work to do what’s right to keep myself healthy is when I started seeing all the work
                        pay off and got me here.”</p>
                    <p>The Spartans secured their second straight team title for the first time in school history — even
                        after falling to rival W.T. Woodson in the district and region championships.</p>
                    <p>“We didn’t win the small prize and we didn’t win the medium prize, but we won the large prize,
                        and that’s the one that goes down in history,” Coach Chris Pellegrini said. </p>

                    <h4>Jakia Brown-Turner carries a legacy from nearby Bishop McNamara to Maryland</h4>
                    <img src="images /Jakia.webp" alt="Jakia Brown-Turner" width="300">
                    <p>For Terrapin Sports Central</p>
                    <p>November 15, 2023</p>
                    <p>Roughly forty minutes from the Xfinity Center sits a light-hardwood basketball court in Bishop
                        McNamara High School, wrapped with maroon baselines. A brazen gold mustang stands frozen
                        mid-stride at center court, while championship banners stretch behind it across the white
                        cinderblock walls.</p>

                    <p>Jakia Brown-Turner once stood at the top of the Mustang and split through a screen as she set her
                        feet and connected on a mid range jump shot at the elbow. It was two of 22 points the then-high
                        school senior scored that day against Bishop Ireton. </p>

                    <p>Those performances were the standard for Brown-Turner while attending Bishop McNamara. She
                        brought consistency every day, her coach said, and the team knew those performances came every
                        night.</p>

                    <p>Brown-Turner became the school’s all-time leading scorer by the time she graduated and positioned
                        Bishop McNamara to a national rank for multiple weeks in her crescendo campaign. She added
                        Maryland Gatorade Player of the Year honors and a McDonald’s All-American nod to her repertoire
                        that year, the school’s first ever honoree. </p>

                    <p>“She was the reason why Bishop McNamara was successful,” said Frank Oliver Jr., Brown-Turner’s
                        high school coach and current IMG Academy coach. “Her coming in and setting the tone had other
                        players wanting to play with her. Great players wanted to play with her.”</p>
                    <p>Oliver met Brown-Turner when she was in sixth grade at Benjamin Stoddert Middle School. Her coach
                        recalls she had an unusually calming demeanor at a young age, her poise wise beyond her years.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Quietly,” Oliver described, Brown-Turner curated a 30-point performance in her first high school
                        scrimmage against Largo. But the scrimmage was nothing out of the ordinary, as the freshman led
                        Bishop McNamara in scoring her first year and immediately stepped into a leadership role on a
                        team with eight seniors. </p>

                    <p>For The Diamondback</p>
                    <p>March 7, 2024</p>
                    <p>Maryland baseball’s players cramped into Matt Swope’s basement for their team Christmas party
                        last December. Terps memorabilia stretched across the walls while players and coaches donned
                        ugly Christmas sweaters.</p>
                    <p>Some stood, others sat on the U-shaped couch and the rest settled on the carpet. Maryland men’s
                        basketball’s game against Indiana played on the TV.</p>
                    <p>Swope stood before the congregation at the end of the night. The coach had an announcement.</p>
                    <p>He revealed a white Maryland jersey with Kevin Keister’s name on the back and a red No. 3
                        engraved — a number reserved for the team captain that the infielder coveted.</p>
                    <p>“Three has been the number that the captain wears and this year, we think the kid that deserves
                        to wear it is [Kevin],” Keister recalled Swope saying.</p>
                    <p>Keister and Swope grew together over the last three years and have a shared competitiveness. That
                        fierce drive created friction at first, but culminated in Keister being named the team’s leader.
                        It’s a familiar position for the shortstop.</p>
                    <p>Swope was the first Maryland coach to call Keister during his high school career. He met the
                        then-hitting coach on a visit in September 2018 and committed later that month.</p>
                    <p>Keister, who played second base his first three years with the Terps, didn’t see much time as a
                        freshman. He recorded only four hits — each of them singles — all season.</p>
                    <p>Swope sought more power from Keister’s approach. The infielder recognizes now that he was a weak
                        hitter entering college, but was satisfied with his swing and content with only hitting singles.
                        The two argued over fine-tuning his approach. </p>

                    <For Terrapin Sports Central>

                    </For>
                    <p>Hawa Doumbouya was starstruck when she learned Brionna Jones joined Maryland women’s basketball’s
                        coaching staff.</p>
                    <p>The freshman center was sitting in a film session with her teammates when it was announced that
                        the former Terp and two-time WNBA All-Star joined the team’s staff as its Director of Player
                        Personnel. Doumbouya then sprinted to the locker room and grabbed a shoe for the Connecticut Sun
                        center to sign.</p>
                    <p>“I was fangirling a little bit … I haven’t worn them since,” Doumbouya said.</p>
                    <p>Jones played for the Terps from 2013 to 2017, a key contributor of back-to-back Final Four runs.
                        Jones finished her collegiate career with a 65 percent field goal rate — a Big Ten record — and
                        is tied for seventh all-time in program history with 1,928 points.</p>
                    <p>Jones joined Maryland’s staff in October, unable to play overseas in her offseason due to a
                        ruptured Achilles in June. Doumbouya — who is tied as the tallest player in coach Brenda Frese’s
                        tenure in College Park at 6-foot-7 — was immediately excited about the opportunity to learn from
                        an established center.</p>
                    <p>“I’m gonna take full advantage of her,” Doumbouya said.</p>
                    <p>Jones is not permitted to work on the court with Doumbouya due to not being one of the five
                        designated assistant coaches on the staff, per NCAA rules. The work around for Doumbouya is a
                        film session with Jones following every game to find “little things” to improve on.</p>
                    <p>Jones discovered that Doumbouya often rushed when she received a pass — she would immediately try
                        to put up a shot after catching the ball. Jones wanted Doumbouya to slow down to process the
                        court.</p>
                    <p>Doumbouya’s post moves was an immediate focus for Jones. She showed Doumbouya different footwork
                        to utilize in the post after catching a pass.</p>
