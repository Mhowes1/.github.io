                    <p> Under the Shell began the second I stepped onto Maryland's campus. Even before walked into a
                        class with my grey Under Armour backpack slung acorss my shoulders.</p>
                    <p>I met Sam Jane and Brendan Weissel at freshman orientation. Summer heat beamed onto the
                        pavement outside the Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center as I introduced myself to the two for the
                        first time. We all had an interest in sport journalism.</p>
                    <p>It was naturally suggested that the three of us start a podcast talking about Maryland
                        Athletics. We followed through. We recorded our first episode in the opening month of
                        college.</p>
                    <p>The podcast had a simple format: interview a guest for the first 20-40 minutes, and then
                        dicuss that week's games. The first guest was Tyler Cronin, Maryland baseball's trainer.
                    </p>
                    <p>Flash forward one year later, we are now interviewing championship-winning coaches and
                        legendary Maryland athletes. The show is now hosted on Testudo Times, with weekly hour-long
                        episodes. My interviewing skills have substantially increased from the podcast. </p>
